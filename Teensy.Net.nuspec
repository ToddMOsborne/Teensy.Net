    <description>Provides an easy to use and efficient C# and .Net interface for PJRC Teensy devices, including discovery and state management. It has the ability to upload HEX files using the API or by using the sample Uploader Windows Form application. The API has just a few classes and is very well documented in code. The sample Uploader application is heavily commented and shows off most of the capabilities of the assembly. There is no other documentation available at this time. Currently, it requires hidlibrary, which is referenced in the NuGet packages file. I have plans to remove this dependency in the near future.</description>
